# Neuralnet
This site is constructed to show a neural network c++ program for controling robots.

You are required to add -DDEBUG=true/false option at compiling. If you do true, you will have many messages for understanding the program. Maybe, too much ^^;

Sorry. This program is too slow. I don't know why. I revise this program with JAVA. The JAVA version of this program became almost 100 times faster than this program. It is amzing!!!

You have to use the JAVA version of this program.

The above program can also execute a deeplearning method "Autoencoder".
