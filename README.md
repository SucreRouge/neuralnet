# Neuralnet
This site is constructed to show a neural network c++ program for controling robots.

You are required to add -DDEBUG=true/false option at compiling. If you do true, you will have many messages for understanding the program. Maybe, too much ^^;

This progura is too slow. You will have to use the JAVA version of this program.

The above program can also execute a deeplearning method "Autoencoder". Please use it.
